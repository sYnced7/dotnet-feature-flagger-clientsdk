# Feature Flags Client for .NET

A simple, open-source alternative client for **GitLab feature flags** in .NET applications.  

This library allows you to easily retrieve and work with GitLab feature flags in your .NET projects, without relying on the official Unleash client.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

The official **Unleash client** can be difficult to work with in .NET environments, and sometimes doesn’t integrate smoothly with GitLab’s feature flag system.  

This project is a **community-driven alternative** to simplify working with feature flags in .NET applications.

> **Note:** I do **not** work for GitLab and this project is not affiliated with GitLab. It is a standalone, open-source alternative built for convenience and flexibility.
